- name: Jacqueline Ng Lane
  image: /2019/boston/images/jlane.jpg
  bio: "Jacqueline Ng Lane is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Business School at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH).  Her research integrates insights from organizational theory, technology adoption, team effectiveness, and social networks to better understand how companies can implement new technologies to more effectively collaborate, share knowledge and improve organizational outcomes. A second avenue of her research examines people’s socio-technical motivations for forming, maintain, and dissolving collaborative ties with others, particularly when organizing into interdisciplinary or diverse teams. She holds a PhD in Management Sciences from Northwestern University, where she was a member of the Science of Networks in Communities (SONIC) lab and Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO). Before her PhD, Jacqueline worked in sales & trading, equity research, and customer relationship management. She earned an executive MBA from Columbia University and a B.S.E in Operations Research & Financial Engineering from Princeton University."

- name: Brooke Foucault Welles
  image: /2019/boston/images/bwelles.jpg
  bio: "Brooke Foucault Welles is an Associate Professor in the department of Communication Studies and core faculty of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. Combining the methods of network science with theories from the social sciences, Foucault Welles studies how online communication networks enable and constrain behavior, with particular emphasis on how these networks facilitate the pursuit of individual, team, and collective goals. Much of her work is interdisciplinary and collaborative, with co-authors from computer science, political science, digital humanities, design, and public health. Her recent contributions include a series of studies of the transformative power of networked counterpublics, techniques for the longitudinal analysis of communication networks using event-based network analysis, and guidelines for the effective use of network visualizations in scientific and lay publications. Her work is funded by grants from the US Army Research Office and US Army Research Lab, and has been featured in leading social science journals such as the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication and Society, and The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. She serves on the editorial board of the journal Web Science and was part of the team that developed the Network Literacy Essential Concepts and Core Ideas."

  bio: "Jinhua Zhao is the Edward and Joyce Linde Associate Professor of City and Transportation Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Prof. Zhao brings behavioral science and transportation technology together to shape travel behavior, design mobility system and reform urban policies. He develops methods to sense, predict, nudge and regulate travel behavior; designs multimodal mobility system that integrates autonomous vehicles, shared mobility and public transport; and reform urban policies to govern the new technologies and business models. Prof. Zhao sees transportation as a language to describe a person, to characterize a city, and to understand an institution. Prof. Zhao leads long-term research collaborations with major transportation authorities and operators worldwide including London, Chicago, Hong Kong and Singapore. He holds Master of Science, Master of City Planning and Ph.D. degrees from MIT and a Bachelor's degree from Tongji University. Prof. Zhao directs the Urban Mobility Lab (mobility.mit.edu) at MIT and is the founder of the MIT Automated Mobility Policy Project."
